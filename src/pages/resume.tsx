          I'm a full-stack engineer that is deeply passionate about UI/UX, the
          web, design, data visualization, and mobile SW development. I enjoy
          stretching my skills in various areas including fields beyond
          engineering (ex. design, usability testing). That being said, I love
          being an engineer and solving complex problems. There is nothing
          better than knowing that your hard work can directly translate into
          making a person's life easier/better/more enjoyable.

            <li>
              Creating next-generation distributed deep learning infrastructure
              and services to support ML engineers. Engine ML empowers any ML
              team to be able to rapidly build state of th art models by
              leveraging GPU-enabled computation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built Engine ML's UI and application backend from the ground up
              using modern best practices. The sole engineer designing and

            </li>
            <li>
              Rearchitected the application to support collaborative paradigms

            </li>
            <li>
              Migrated all of Engine ML's APIs to GraphQL with proper
              authentication and authorization. Migrated the UI from being REST
              based to GraphQL.
            </li>
            <li>
              Converted the UI to be fully live-updating with the careful use of

            <li>
              Crafted various custom components to support various use-cases.
              These included a live log viewer with ANSI character highlighting,
              a file brower, top-level application search with hot-key support,
              code snippets with syntax highlighting, and many more.
